# Journalyst

Journalyst is an Obsidian plugin that helps keep track of your daily journaling. It provides a simple interface to create and manage daily journal entries. To use it, simply designate a folder in your vault as your journal folder, and any folders within that folder will be used to create a Journal.

Each journal entry is a markdown file with a filename in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. The plugin provides a simple interface to create new entries, as well as see which days you completed a journal entry for each given Journal for the current month.

This allows for easy tracking of your daily journaling, and provides a simple way to create new entries for each day. You could for example have a journal for your personal life, and another for your work life, another for sleep tracking and so on.
