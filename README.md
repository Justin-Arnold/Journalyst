# Journalyst

Journalyst is an Obsidian plugin that helps keep track of your daily journaling. It provides a simple interface to create and manage daily journal entries. To use it, simply designate a folder in your vault as your journal folder, and any folders within that folder will be used to create a Journal.

Each journal entry is a markdown file with a filename in the format `YYYY-MM-DD.md`. The plugin provides a simple interface to create new entries, as well as see which days you completed a journal entry for each given Journal for the current month.

This allows for easy tracking of your daily journaling, and provides a simple way to create new entries for each day. You could for example have a journal for your personal life, and another for your work life, another for sleep tracking and so on.

Please feel free to provide feedback and feature requests! I'm happy to help and improve the plugin as it is still in its early stages.
